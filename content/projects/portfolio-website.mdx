This portfolio website itself is a project in AI-assisted development. Built entirely using Cursor IDE with Claude AI, it showcases the power of human-AI collaboration in modern web development.

The entire design process—from the initial concept to the pyramid-themed background and Bengali name crossfade—was developed through iterative conversations with Claude. Each design decision was refined through multiple rounds of feedback, demonstrating how AI can accelerate the creative process while maintaining high design standards.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion

**AI Tools:** Cursor IDE, Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Key Features:**
- Minimalist design inspired by Apple's aesthetic
- 3D pyramid perspective elements
- Bilingual (English/Bengali) interactive text
- Responsive animations and smooth scrolling
- MDX-based content management

This project demonstrates that AI-assisted development isn't about replacing human creativity—it's about amplifying it, allowing rapid iteration and exploration of design ideas that would traditionally take much longer to implement.
