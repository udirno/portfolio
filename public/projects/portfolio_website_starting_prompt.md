# Portfolio Website — Starting Prompt

## Context

You are going to help me plan and execute the design of a personal portfolio website. I’ll be using **Cursor** and **Claude Code**, and eventually I’ll need you to generate a clean, well-structured Cursor prompt that I can directly use.

I own the domain **udirno.com**, which I purchased through a third-party provider. There’s currently nothing deployed on it, and I’ve never done this before, so I’ll need guidance on both development and setup.

## Design Goals

The website should be simple and clean—similar to Apple’s UI.

- Minimalist design
- Clean typography
- Smooth, tasteful animations
- Polished scrolling interactions

I’m open to using tools like **Next.js** or any other technologies you recommend. If a database is needed, I’d prefer a free option such as **Supabase**, but I’m flexible.

## Technical Expectations

- Follow SEO best practices
- Be clearly documented
- Remain simple enough that someone else could replicate the project using this prompt

## Content Structure

Based on my resume, the site should include:

- A section highlighting my projects (especially AI-related work)
- Additional sections for creative projects or other content I may add in the future

The site should be easy to modify and extend over time.

## Tooling Notes

I’ve heard Cursor recently introduced a **Design UI** with drag-and-drop editing that modifies the underlying code. If that’s useful for this project, I’m open to using it.

## Project Setup

I’ll be building everything inside a folder called **Website** on my desktop.

I’d like you to:

- Structure the entire project
- Ask any relevant clarifying questions (tools, architecture, design decisions)
- Guide me step by step toward a final, clean Cursor prompt

For now, focus on providing the best framework and advice to get this project started.
