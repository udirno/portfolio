## The Problem

Building a portfolio website traditionally takes weeks: designing mockups, setting up frameworks, writing components, styling layouts, adding animations, fixing bugs. By the time you&apos;re done, you&apos;ve spent more time on the website than the projects you&apos;re showcasing.

## The Solution

This website was built in a single weekend using AI-assisted development with Claude Code and Cursor. Instead of writing every line from scratch, I focused on design direction and architecture while AI handled the implementation details.

### What Makes This Different

- **AI-first workflow**: Used Claude Code for component generation and refactoring
- **Rapid iteration**: What would take days in traditional development took hours
- **Modern stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4—no compromises on quality
- **Unique design**: Custom animated pyramid backgrounds, Bengali name hover effect, magnetic card interactions

### The Tech Stack

Built on cutting-edge web technologies:
- **Next.js 16** with App Router for modern React patterns
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth, performant animations
- **MDX** for easy content management

### Development Approach

1. Defined design vision and aesthetic direction (Apple-inspired minimalism + unique pyramid motif)
2. Used Claude Code to scaffold components and implement features
3. Iterated on design with Cursor for fine-tuning
4. Focused energy on content and user experience, not boilerplate

## The Impact

From zero to deployed in a weekend. The site showcases my projects while itself being a demonstration of modern AI-assisted development. It proves that with the right tools, solo developers can ship professional-grade products at unprecedented speed.

**The future of development isn&apos;t replacing developers—it&apos;s augmenting them.**
